CPEG 652 Parallel Programming Project

## Project Description
Every student will propose a computational application that you will execute on a parallel 
machine of your choice. Improve the application in some way that enhances parallelism 
and measures the resulting performance. Describe your experience in 4-6 pages.
The objective of this project is that you gain experience in:
* identifying code sections in a program that can be parallelized, 
* learning about a parallel programming model and language, 
* possibly installing a compiler and/or library to facilitate your project
* identifying a parallel machine on which to run and measure the program, and 
* analyzing parallel program performance

For obtaining a good grade, what counts is not so much that you can speed up
your program, but that you demonstrate in your report an understanding of these
five points. The expectation is that you spend two to three hours per week on this project.
